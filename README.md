# car-scraper

Recently I decided to buy a used car.

I'm looking at Toyota Rav4, Honda C-RV, Mazda CX-5, Ford Kuga and Hyndai Tucson.

The issue is that not all official second hand retailers for Bulgaria have an option on their website to subscibe to updates based on preferences.

I want to make a scraper which will pull all of the information for those specific models like year of production, distance travelled, image and price.

Will do it in python as I hear python is the language for scraping.
